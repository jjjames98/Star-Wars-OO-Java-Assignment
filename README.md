# Star-Wars-OO-Java-Assignment
An assignment where the base code of a complex OO program was given to us where we needed to expand and connect to the existing code with new functionality using common OO practices.

New classes that were created include Force.Java, Train.Java and Droid.Java as well as any necessary changes in existing classes to integrate the new classes.
